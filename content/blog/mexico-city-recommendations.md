I was born and raised in Mexico City, and I often get the question of what are my favorite places or plans to visit in Mexico City I enjoy that are compatible with foreigners and shine a light on some of the things Mexico has to offer.



### Recommended Day 1 - Zocalo and Bellas Artes:


Get to Bellas Artes (palace of fine arts). Go in, see the nice paintings, then when you head outside, to the left, you don't want to miss the "Sanborns de los Azulejos", it is beautifully decorated, a store and a restaurant. The lines are long, so I don't recommend lingering around here. Continue walking in calle madero, all the way to the Zocalo. In the Zocalo you can see to the left Mexico City's central cathedral and to the front the National palace, where the president lives.

I recommend having lunch/dinner in Hotel de Mexico, it is a century-old hotel with a rooftop view of zocalo that is super worth it. If for some reason its too full or not feeling like it, you can go to "Casino Español de México" which is an amazing Spanish restaurant in the center of Mexico. If you have some extra time, you can visit the Templo mayor next to the cathedral that shows the ruins of the burried aztec remains below the cathedral!

That's a pretty good day by itself. 

### Recommended day 2 - Polanco, Masaryk:

Start with a cute breakfast at [Catamundi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/arjSXcex7QPWBuzPA?g_st=ic). It is a bougie nice place to have breakfast. Once you finish, check out the bookstore/coffeeshop next door, "Cafebreria el Pendulo" Masaryk is beautifully decorated, depending on the day. Walking through Masaryk and Polanco is pretty nice. I recommend walking through Masaryk and having lunch there after spending time through the Lincoln park.

After you finish with Masaryk, take an Uber to the "Soumaya Museum" if you are into museums. This museum has wonderful works of art from all over the world. It is owned by Mexico's richest man, Carlos Slim, and has a lot of exhibitions there (6 floors!)

For dinner, have some authentic taco experience at "[Taqueria Selene](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZRvW4zUQk8Nyjj2s5)" these are more of the "street" tacos which are the best here. Get pastor tacos here.

### Recommended day 3 - Chapultepec:

Get to Chapultepec park, close to the Chapultepec castle, this is more of a park hike, all the way to Chapultepec castle, a beautiful castle created by one of Mexico's emperors (I'm guessing you didn't know mexico had an emperor?) really cool place filled with history. If you like anthropology more than castles, go to the National Anthropology Museum. 

In the afternoon, if you are not too tired, I recommend strolling through reforma and seeing the "The Angel of Independence" I recommend eating in "El Bajio" in the Reforma 222 plaza.

### Recommended day 4 - Piramides de teohihuacan:

There is many more things to see, but a good 4th day is booking a trip to the Teotihuacan pyramid. It's a nice trip to see some aztec pyramids. If you plan on going, DO book a tour.
