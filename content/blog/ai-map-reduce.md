Do you remember MapReduce? That distributed computing pattern that powered early Google and Hadoop? "Mapping" a lot of tasks to some compute clusters, then "reducing" the results? Well, I've been experimenting with applying the same concept to AI tasks using Claude Code, and the results have been surprisingly powerful. This is already being used to generate RAGs, but it's a lot more fun to try it locally in your own documents.

## The problem: AI Tasks don't scale linearly.

When you have a large set of tasks, throwing a huge context or getting a huge ToDo list as a tool call, is not useful, after a while the context window "limits" itself and starts to be less effective. This leads to us having long processing time with no intermediate results. 

It also makes it hard to debug when things go wrong.

## Enter AI 'Map Reduce'.

The concept is simple: use Claude Code's headless -p flag in a parallel manner to solve small tasks, and then have some process to summarize or have another process pick get the summaries.

Here's the pattern, 

```
# Map phase: Process each chunk
for item in dataset; do
  claude -p "Analyze this item and output JSON: $item" \
  > "output_${item}.json" &
done
wait

# Reduce:
jq [...]
# or 
claude -p "Aggregate these JSON files into a summary" \
--input "output_*.json" > final_result.json
```

Note that you can reduce with LLMs or with deterministic methods, whetever you are trying to do, I personally recommend deterministic methods not to add more randomness into the process.

## Example use case:
Analyze my blog posts.

Instead of asking claude to go and do a bunch of web calls to analyze my code, I chunked it to several processes and then "reduced them"

```
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p analysis_output

for post in content/blog/*.md; do
  echo "Analyzing $(basename "$post")..."
  claude -p "Analyze this blog post and extract key metrics as JSON:

$(cat "$post")

Required Output Format (JSON only):
{
  \"title\": \"\",
  \"word_count\": 0,
  \"reading_time_minutes\": 0,
  \"main_topics\": [],
  \"tone\": \"technical|personal|educational\",
  \"complexity_score\": 1-10,
  \"key_insights\": [],
  \"technologies_mentioned\": [],
  \"actionable_takeaways\": ["",""]
}

Be precise and consistent with the JSON structure." \
  > "analysis_output/$(basename "$post" .md).json" &
    
    # Prevent overwhelming the API
    if (( $(jobs -r | wc -l) >= 3 )); then
        wait
    fi
done
wait
```

Then, for each of my posts, I get something like this:
```
{
  "title": "AI Map Reduce",
  "word_count": 387,
  "reading_time_minutes": 2,
  "main_topics": ["AI task parallelization", "Map Reduce pattern", "Claude Code CLI", "Performance optimization"],
  "tone": "technical",
  "complexity_score": 6,
  "key_insights": [
    "AI tasks don't scale linearly with large contexts or todolists",
    "Parallel processing with Claude Code's headless flag can solve scalability issues",
    "Breaking large AI tasks into smaller chunks provides better debugging and intermediate results",
    "Deterministic reduction methods are preferable to LLM-based reduction to avoid added randomness"
  ],
  "technologies_mentioned": ["Map Reduce", "Hadoop", "Claude Code", "bash", "JSON", "MCP tools"],
  "actionable_takeaways": [
    "Use Claude Code's -p flag with parallel processing for large dataset analysis",
    "Implement job control (limiting concurrent processes) to prevent API overwhelming",
    "Structure outputs as JSON for easier aggregation in the reduce phase",
    "Create intermediate output files for better debugging and progress tracking"
  ]
}
```

This way, I can check what are my most complex blog posts, categorize them, or add more relevant tags to all of them!

Now, as it is obvious, **AIs are really bad at counting words, or doing numerical things, but in this case... I don't care too much!** I think these techniques are better for things where I need a *"good enough"* anwser.

As a practical example, this makes it really awesome to get a summary of all the takeaways of my blogs:
```
for file in *.json; do
  jq -r --arg filename "$file" '
    "[\(.title)](blog/\($filename))",
    (.actionable_takeaways[] | "- \(.)")
  ' "$file"
  printf "\n"
done
```
*(See them below the closing!)*

Experiment with AI Map Reduce and let me know what you think! My next steps would be trying this with something like LangChain and make it more like a state machine. Let me know here or in the comments what you think, it might not be novel, but it's pretty fun.
