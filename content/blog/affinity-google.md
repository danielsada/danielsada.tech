Hey everyone, here's a [.aftemplate file for you to download](https://github.com/danielsada/danielsada.tech/blob/master/static/GoogleAds.aftemplate?raw=true) that includes all of the Display Google Ads templates.

Edit November 25 2020: It seems [there is a bug](https://forum.affinity.serif.com/index.php?/topic/68338-1-extra-pixel-when-exporting/) which generates an extra pixel when exporting, you need to put it in a integer (not decimal) X and Y position for it to export to the right size. I've updated the file with correct X and Y positions.
