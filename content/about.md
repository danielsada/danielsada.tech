Hello! I'm Daniel Sada. I like to write in danielsada.tech. I work on the OneNote Sync and Storage team, where I get to do fun distributed stuff with all the different OneNote clients. I'm specially passionate about improving and having good cultures on teams. I've been lucky to have worked on: OneNote, Microsoft Project Desktop and Server, Chromium edge, Windows 10X, Surface Neo. As well as for eCommerce platforms as QSwimwear, Tommy Hilfiger Mexico, Home Depot Mexico, and Office Depot Mexico. I founded [Sadeira](http://sadeira.com) which was a consulting firm in Mexico that specialized in marketing and software.
