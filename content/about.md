Hello! I'm Daniel Sada. I like to write here. 
I like to sleep at night knowing [my services are OK](https://danielsada.tech/blog/cloud-services-dos/), I've written blog posts about software that [saves me more than 100 hours of time](https://danielsada.tech/blog/programs-that-have-saved-hn-100hours/) and I used to be a OneNote Services developer. I've tried every coffee shop in a 25 mile radius around my house. I write in English and Spanish. I work at Snowflake improving Developer Productivity.

My latest conference talk: [How to sleep at night having a cloud service at DevOpsDays Rockies 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU_pUFd0kjY)
