I'm writing here to list some of the mexican candy I've given, as well as allergens and a little bit of context about em.
**Basically all things here might contain nuts, so proceed at your own risk.**

# Alegria
Amaranth with honey, a.k.a "mexican rice krispies" but instead of rice, amaranth.

# Dulce de Leche
One of my favorites, it's milk, sugar and cinnamon they get their brown color from the caramel in sugar.

# Palanqueta
Roasted peanut bar, with seeds, and can contain piloncillo or honey

"Piloncillo is made by crushing sugar cane and collecting the juice. The sugar cane juice is then boiled and reduced to a thick syrup (similar to molasses). Then, the syrup is poured into molds and dried. The word piloncillo means “little loaf”, which is a traditional shape in which the sugar is molded."

# Tamarind Candy
Tamarind Candy is a candy made from the tamarind fruit, mixed with sugar to get that acid and sweet candy. The pulp is molded to a ball and mixed with sugar.
